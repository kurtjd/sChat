TODO
====
Interface short term:

-Redraw on window resize
-Fix strange bug where a MAX_MSG_LEN of exactly 300 or 500 causes problems, but no other numbers do (AFAIK)
-Make messages break at words when hitting end of screen, rather than mid-word as it is now
-Make message display fancier
-Allow scrolling through chat history via arrow keys
-Allow message to be longer than screen length by having message scroll as user types it
-Break show_message_history() into smaller functions

Longish term:

-Add '.schat' file where users can specify some default settings
-Implement basic command processor ie: /quit = quit program
-Add various run flags for options
-Add encryption
-Add 'buddy' lists where you can map names to IP addresses


Network:

-Add send and receive functions
